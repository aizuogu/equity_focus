# Equity in Policy: Toxic Facilities in Oxnard and Malibu
*Does the socio-economic demographics of an area correlate with the disproportionate distribution of toxic facility waste, especially in identified disadvantaged communities, that are environmental injustice concerns?*

## Introduction
In exploring data about disadvantaged communities and their proximity to toxic facilities, we have chosen to focus on exploring this data spatially and the implications it has on racial, environmental and political injustice. My partner and I have centered racial equality as one of the cores of  our interests and want to explore this within an environmental justice framework. We hope that through spatial data we can create a visual representation of the threat faced by disadvantaged communities in residential areas and their proximity to toxic sites. We hope to represent how environmental problems disproportionately affect lower income and people of color. Ultimately this research would aid in the realization of the sense of urgency needed to  alleviate the public health concerns faced by disadvantaged communities near such facilities. The public health concerns raised by toxic facilities puts many at risk, but we are choosing to address the way it affects lower income communities and people of color at higher rates. 

## Sources/Data
- EnviroStor: https://www.envirostor.dtsc.ca.gov/public/map/?myaddress=malibu
     - Will use to identify the amount and location of toxic facilities in each identified city for comparison
- Toxic Tides: https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/toxictides/case-studies?authuser=0
     - Will use to investigate severity of toxic sites and environmental injustice within polluted cities.
- Census Data: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/lagunabeachcitycalifornia,richmondcitycalifornia,oxnardcitycalifornia,malibucitycalifornia/PST045221
    - Will use to compare cities by demographics such as population size, racial make-up, median household makeup and poverty rate.
- EPA Toxic Release Facilities: (https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program)
  -Will use to locate and identify the facilities, including their name, address, sector type and amount of releases in weight. 

## Research Methodology
Data conducted by the University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles and their project, “Toxic Tides,” maps the density in city/neighborhood of toxic facilities like power Plants, sewage treatment, hazardous waste treatment, landfulls, and incinerators, refineries, oil and gas wells etc. This data provides important spatial data on disadvantaged communities like Wilmington, Oxnard and Richmond in California. We are using data from the Toxic Release Inventory, research conducted by the EPA, that maps the location of toxic releases in California. This information is a building block to spatially represent the areas of toxic release, their types and which communities are more at risk of adverse health effects. We are choosing to keep our scope within a city like Oxnard and juxtapose this map to a city of a varying racial makeup and median household incomes like Malibu.(Update: after exploring Malibu we learned that there were no toxic releases in this city, while this is a significant finding on its own we are looking to explore another city that provides better spatial data). We want to create a comparative analysis that visually displays the racial disparities taking place. Our research will be composed of data mapping the location and quantity of toxic facilities within Oxnard, this can be accomplished using the EnviroStor Database and EPA Toxic Release Inventory Database that contains information on the location and other relevant information of these facilities.We also plan to use the census and data on racial demographics and median household income in both Oxnard and Los Angeles.

## Conclusion
Oxnard and other disadvantaged communities have a disproportionate amount of hazardous facilities within their city limits and a disproportionate amount of toxic releases. This could expose communities to a plethora of toxins and pollutants and pose a great public health concern. Through our research we plan to explore this data with an environmental justice framework. Our goal is to visually display and address the disparities of the proximity between toxic release facilities and residential areas in a majority Non-Hispanic White area.
