# Equity in Policy: Toxic Facilities in Oxnard and Malibu
*Does socio-economic demographics of an area seem to affect the policies created and implemented, especially in identified disadvantaged communities, that explicitly address environmental injustice?*

## Introduction
In exploring data about disadvantaged communities and their proximity to toxic facilities, we have chosen to focus on exploring this data spatially and the implications it has on racial, environmental and political injustice. My partner and I have centered racial equality as one of the cores of  our interests and want to explore the intersection because racial equality and environmental justice. We hope that through spatial data we can create a visual representation of the threat faced by disadvantaged communities and their proximity to toxic sites. We hope to represent how environmental problems disproportionately affect lower income and people of color. Ultimately this research would urge policy change and mitigation between key players in order to alleviate the public health concerns faced by disadvantaged communities. The public health concerns raised by toxic facilities puts many at risk, but we are choosing to address the way it affects lower income communities and people of color at higher rates. 

## Sources/Data
- EnviroStor: https://www.envirostor.dtsc.ca.gov/public/map/?myaddress=malibu
     - Will use to identify the amount and location of toxic facilities in each identified city for comparison
- SCAG SB 535 Disadvantaged Areas: https://gisdata-scag.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SCAG::sb-535-disadvantaged-areas/about
     - Will use to identify whether identified cities are disadvantaged areas based on criteria of Senate Bill 535.
- Toxic Tides: https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/toxictides/case-studies?authuser=0
     - Will use to investigate severity of toxic sites and environmental injustice within polluted cities.
- Census Data: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/lagunabeachcitycalifornia,richmondcitycalifornia,oxnardcitycalifornia,malibucitycalifornia/PST045221
    - Will use to compare cities by demographics such as population size, racial make-up, median household makeup and poverty rate.

## Reseach Methodology
Data conducted by the University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles and their project, “Toxic Tides,” maps the density in city/neighborhood of toxic facilities like power Plants, sewage treatment, hazardous waste treatment, landfulls, and incinerators, refineries, oil and gas wells etc. This data provides important spatial data on disadvantaged communities like Wilmington, Oxnard and Richmond in California. We are choosing to keep our scope within a city like Oxnard and juxtapose this map to a city of a varying racial makeup and range of median household incomes like Malibu. We want to create a comparative analysis that visually displays the racial disparities taking place. Our research will be composed of data mapping the location and quantity of toxic facilities within Malibu, this can be accomplished using the EnviroStor Database that contains information on the location of these facilities. We also plan to map disadvantaged communities as defined by SCAG. We also plan to use the census and data on racial demographics and median household income in both Oxnard and Malibu.

## Conclusion
Oxnard and other disadvantaged communities have a disproportionate amount of hazardous facilities within their city limits. This could expose communities to a plethora of toxins and pollutants and poses a great public health concern. Through our research we plan to explore the intersection of racial justice and environmental justice. Our goal is to visually display and address the disparities, question what policy is driving this inequality and what policy and protections can be enacted in order to address not only the environmental crisis, but the racial inequities taking place.
