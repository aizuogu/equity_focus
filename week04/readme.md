# Equity in Policy: Toxic Facilities in Oxnard and Malibu 
[Proposal](https://github.com/aizuogu/equity_focus/tree/main/Group%20Assignments)
## Roles 
Antonia: Co-Lead and collecting Oxnard City related data

Lupe: Co-Lead and collecting Malibu City related data
## Status update
Toward of end of this past week, we realized we need to redirect our project idea. We restructured our research question and rethought our intended goals. We had wanted to incorporate data on the differing enviromental policy in Oxnard and Malibu, but were struggling to find data that could spatially represent this. Next week, we will focus on residential proximity to toxic waste sites with recent toxic releases recorded, based on the US EPA Toxic Release Inventory data. Going in this new direction will allow us integrate more geospatial data and tools in answering our question compared to our original idea. The general mood of our team is good.
## Data update
We will use the US EPA Toxic Release Inventory (https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program) to locate toxic waste sites with recent reported releases, especially in Oxnard, CA. We are still deciding to analyze Malibu, CA due to the lack of reported releases or compare Oxnard to a different city. We will also use California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment's CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Indicator Map( https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/maps-data) to show the proximity of population characteristics nearest the facilities such as rates of low birth rate, housing burden, cardiovascular disease and other factors. This would be an exploration of the location and density of toxic facilities, their proximity to residential homes and the rate of aforementioned variables in given areas. These are factors that may be be related to the toxic waste the facilities release due to living close to the sites. We had also previously intended to use data from census reporter to further describe and provide insight into our city's demographics. 
## Concerns
1. Ploting longitude and latitude on an Open Street Map from a csv file, instead of mapping centeriods. --> Major Concern, because we need to figure out how to plot the facilities on the OSM file to create a complete Ischron map to assess proximity to residential areas
2. Settling on another city to replace with Malibu, CA or just analyze Oxnard, CA --> Minor Concern, because our group will decide on this soon) will comparing our two cities embelish our research or would it be more compelling to analyze the dynamics of one place. 
3. Whether to keep the policy component of or original proposal --> Minor Concern, because that portion is not as big as the main output of the Ischron map
4. Organizing, cutting down and renaming varibles on large data set from---US EPA Toxic Release, how to loop functions and work with large data set--> Major Conern
5. Overlaying basemap with with centriods-->Minor Concern
