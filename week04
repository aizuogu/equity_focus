Project title and link to proposal
Roles (only for groups): Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."
Status update: Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
Data update: Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.
Concerns: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."
